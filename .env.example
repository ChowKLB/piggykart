# Exchange Rate API
# This is used to convert between different currencies in the app. We're currently using Open Exchange Rates to sync exchange rate data and, at the moment, that requies a $47/mo subscription. This is NOT required to run Maybe, but it is required to sync exchange rate data. In the future we'll be adding support for other exchange rate APIs that are cheaper/free.
