# Maybe
We're in the earliest stages (exploratory, really) of building an open source investment tracking + optimization platform.

In its previous life, Maybe was a personal finance and wealth management platform that unfortunately wasn't economically viable. We're now taking another pass in the finance space to see how we can help people grow their wealth in meaningful ways.

## Stack

The tech stack will likely involve some combination of...

* Ruby
* Rails
* Postgres
* Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus)
* Tailwind

May need to look in to something like Timescale, but want to avoid overcomplicating from the start if we can.
