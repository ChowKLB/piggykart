The fastest way to get your own version of Maybe running is a "one-click deploy". Below are the currently supported platforms:

## One-Click Deploys

### Render (recommended)

**Estimated cost:** $0-14 per month (one-click deploy is FREE, but for optimal performance, it will cost a minimum of $14 for the database and web service)

#### Step 1: Create Render Blueprint

1. Click the button below:

</a>

2.

## Docker

**Estimated cost:** $5-15 per month

_Docker is not yet supported, but will be soon._

## Self hosting disclaimer

While we attempt to provide cost-effective deployment options, please remember, **self-hosting _may_ incur monthly charges on your hosting platform of choice**. While we provide cost estimates for each deployment option, it is your responsibility to manage these costs.
